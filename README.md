# CdmInspection
R Package to support quality control inspection of an OMOP-CDM instance

# Introduction
The European Health Data and Evidence Network (EHDEN) project has multiple yearly Open Calls for financial support for data partners to map their data to the OMOP-CDM, for more information see the [EHDEN](https://www.ehden.eu/open-calls/process-overview/) website. In additon, EHDEN is training Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in Europe to provide services to the data partners to map their data to the OMOP-CDM. A large number of these SMEs are now active all over Europe as shown in the [SME Catalogue](https://www.ehden.eu/business-directory/). 

Quality control of the mapping is clearly important and therefore a procedure has been developed called SME Inspection in which a certified SME performs a series of tests on the CDM and produces a report that is send to the EHDEN Team for review. The template for this report can be found [here](https://github.com/EHDEN/CdmInspection/blob/master/extras/Inspection_Report%20_Template_v1%20.docx). The goal of the inspection report is to provide insight into the completeness, transparency and quality of the performed Extraction Transform, and Load (ETL) process and the readiness of the data partner to be onboarded in the EHDEN and OHDSI data networks and participate in research studies. If the SME that is performing the inspection was not involved in the ETL implementation we advise to use a two-stage inspection process. A first inspection report can be made to provide recommendations to the Data Partner on how to improve the ETL and processes, if necessary. Ideally, this includes a site visit of the SME after providing instructions on the content of the report. The Data Partner can share this draft report with EHDEN to obtain additional input. Once the improvements have been made the final report can be created by the SME and send to EHDEN for approval.  

The CdmInspection R Package is part of this SME Inspection procedure and performs the following checks on top of the required [Data Quality Dashboard](https://github.com/OHDSI/DataQualityDashboard) step:

# Features

**Vocabulary Checks**  
1. For all custom mapped vocabularies extract the top 50 codes order by frequency from the source_to_concept map. The SME has to approve these top 50 codes. All custom mappings will be extracted as well as part of the package output. Note if the source_to_concept map is not used in the ETL process this information still has to be provided manually for the inspection.
2. For each domain generate statistics on the number of unmapped codes and and unmapped records.
3. Extract the vocabulary table.
4. Count of concepts per vocabulary by standard, classification and non-standard.
5. Mapping levels of drugs (Clinical Drug etc.)

**Technical Infrastructure Checks**
1. Execution of short and longer running queries to test the performance of the system. This information is useful for the SME to provide further guidance on optimizing the infrastructure.
2. Checks on the number of CPUs, memory available in R.
3. Extract the versions of all installed R packages, checks if core [HADES](https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades/) packages are installed.
4. Check if ATLAS is installed and WebAPI is running
5. Check if Achilles results are available in ATLAS.
6. Check if CatalogueExport package can execute correctly.
7. Extraction of CDM_Source table

**Results Document Generation**

Produces a word document in the EHDEN template that contains all the results. This template needs to be completed by the person performing the cdm inspection. The user can also provide a custom template file if required.
